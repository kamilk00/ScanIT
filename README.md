# ScanIT

The goal of the project was to develop a mobile application using .NET platform that allows scanning EAN8, EAN13 barcodes, as well as QR codes.
The application communicates with the database (connectionString has been removed), which allows performing registration and user login operations, 
as well as enabling the recording of information about the scanned codes. 
The user has the ability to add scanned code to favourites, read the list of favourites, or remove a code from this list. 
What is more, it's also possible to read the user's history of scanned codes, change the description of an EAN8 or EAN13 code, and copy the last scanned code to the clipboard memory.
